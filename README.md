## floating_ball_fixture  


FreeCAD design of floating ball fixture for use with [FicTrac](http://rjdmoore.net/fictrac/) and similar floating ball treadmill type setups. It is designed to be machined from aluminum and the step version can be sent somewhere like [Plethora](https://www.plethora.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqouonMCZ2QIVDNtkCh3qjAxtEAAYASAAEgLjkvD_BwE) for manufacturing.  Currently designs which accomodate 10mm, 11mm, and 12mm balls are included. The side mount hole should be tapped with 8-32 threads and the bottom air-fitting hole should be tapped with 1/4-28 threads.
